This is a basic project / starter project for retrieving soil moisture sensor data from a NodeMCU and a soil moisture sensor. The data from the NodeMCU is sent to an API which is updated and shown on a web application. This is a starter template and can be adapted for varios use cases with multiple sensors and endpoints to capture data and show live data with in a web application.
